# Welcome!

Thank you for interviewing at 
[SterlingBackcheck](http://sterlingbackcheck.com)! We hope you find this
process to be fair, transparent, and understandable. Our goal with this
process is to evaluate your skillset, with no "surprises" or "trick
questions" designed to snare the unwary. If you have any questions
about this project or its purpose in the process, please feel free
to email us.

Our goal is not to extract free work out of you with this project;
please spend no more than 15 minutes on this project. We believe that
any developer can complete this in that time.

If you are not familiar with Git, the source control
system used for this project, it is a distributed version control
system (DVCS) similar in concept to Mercurial (hg). Numerous tutorials on
Git are available on the Web, but the key commands that you
will need are:

  * "git clone": To create a clone of the repository.
  * "git branch": To create a branch for your changes
  * "git add": To add files to the local working repo
  * "git commit": To commit local working changes

BitBucket also has a [BitBucket101](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Bitbucket+101) for
those who want to have a look.

Please fork a copy of our project and create your changes as a
pull request.

You are also welcome to take a copy of the repo (see the download
link in the BitBucket menu to the right) and host it in your own
source-control system (a la Github), so long as we can get access
to it and view the repository history.

# UnitTesting (C#)

The project goals are simple: We would like for you to open up the
Sterling.Hr.UnitTesting.sln in Visual Studio 2013 and complete the 2 unit
tests in the Sterling.Hr.Logic.Tests project.  If you don't have Visual 
Studio, you can download the Community Edition which can be found in
[www.visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com).

You are free to use whatever libraries, packages, open-source tools,
or other developer productivity aids you find helpful. If you use
any, please let us know, because we're always looking for ways for
us to improve our own productivity, too.

# Our goals

We have a few things we are looking for as part of this evaluation:

1. We are interested in things like code clarity, consistency and
general code stewardship. We should be able to read the code and 
figure out what's going on, but we don't want you to drown us in 
comments, either.

2. Unit tests are important to us.  Any developer entering our 
organization must be able to understand how to build unit tests and 
have a good understanding on why they are important.

# Feedback

Part of our goal with this process is to be transparent. We believe
that we can always improve, and this process is no exception. We would
love to hear your thoughts about the process (whether we hire you or
not!), and invite you to email us via our contact us webpage to give 
us your thoughts.

We look forward to seeing your work, and talking with you about
this codebase, our combined future, and working together!
